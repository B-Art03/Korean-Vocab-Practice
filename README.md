# Korean Vocabulary Practice
This Website aims to help you test your Korean Vocabulary.

You can find the Website here: soon :)

# What to expect in the future:

## Image Occlusion

You can use the provided images to test if you're able name the various things you see. This will be a basic image occlusion feature at first but may later be expanded to the same functionality as the 3D system.


## 3D Practice

Use an interactive 3D scene to test your vocabulary by both naming things and describing actions. The scenes are made for this website unless otherwise stated.


## Additional Exercises

To further work on your Korean, writing exercises that fit the various images and 3D scenes will be provided. If you feel like writing more but don't know what to write you can choose one of the scenes and get some ideas. There won't be any solutions as it's freeform exercises.


## Group Activities

At some point, the exercises will be adapted to group sessions to be used in study group sessions with everyone benefiting. But that's not the priority for now.


## Plan and Timeline

I'm  still experimenting with the tools I need to make this work. Once I know what's achievable I'll update this and publish a first version. Currently, there is no website online.
